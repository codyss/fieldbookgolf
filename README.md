# fieldbookgolf

Testing the ability to connect to a fieldbook database and play around with the potential to build a database driven app using fieldbook. Provides easy method to store data, display/edit data in GUI, make data available to public, use data in app.


Learned Mongo - Fieldbook removed and now app uses a local MongoDB to save all data

Steps :

1) Sink up fieldbook database to display in express app - DONE
    Switched over to mongo

2) Set up views to display data in pretty way - DONE

3) Sink up kimono tee times api to show tee times too (leverage previous formatting) - DONE

4) Post scores and track handicap - Score posting DONE - needs user page and handicap calculations

5) Test ability to save tee times access to mongo database
  - 'Create pseudo booking functionality, where if a tee time is clicked it is added to a new sheet'

6) Sorting on the tee times page

7) Build search page
